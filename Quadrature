The fortran code shape_function.90 generates a file called 
octant_sn_quadrature.csv containing the quadrature on the unit sphere. 
It can be compiled using for example: 
gfortran -ffree-line-length-none -ffixed-line-length-none   -fdefault-real-8 -o shape_functions shape_functions.f90
and run using
./shape_functions

The file containing the quadrature directions and 
weights associated with the discrete ordinate discretisation of the unit sphere. 
nx_cube, ny_cube are the number of cells across and up for each of 
the eight patches on the octant that produces a discretisation of the unit sphere.

CHANGE nx_cube, ny_cube as necessary to increase the quadrature points 
and do this in the subroutine file_generator4octant_sn_quadrature 
the values are currently set to:  nx_cube=4, ny_cube=4

octant_sn_quadrature.csv contains the file generated with nx_cube=4, ny_cube=4
